# Study Note: Stack and Queue

## Description
- **Stack**:It is a data structure that follows the LIFO rule. Elements are added and removed only from the top.
- **Queue**:It is a data structure that follows the FIFO rule. Elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.  

## Visualization
- **Stack**
```c
Top →      [   ]
           [   ]
           [   ]
           [   ]
Bottom →   [   ]

```
- **Queue**
```c
Front 
Rear
 ↓ ↓
[   ] → [   ] → [   ] → [   ] → [   ]

```
## Characteristics
- **Stack**
- **LIFO**:Last element inserted is the first one removed.
- **Direction**:Both operations happen at the top.

- **Queue**
- **FIFO**:First element inserted is the first removed.
- **Direction**:Input at rear, output at front.


## Time/Space
- **Stack**
- **Array**:O(1) push/pop (if no resize)
- **Linked list**: O(1) push/pop at head

- **Queue**
- **Array**:O(1) enqueue/dequeue with circular buffer
- **Linked list**: O(1) enqueue (at tail) and dequeue (at head

## Limitations
- **Stack**
- **Overflow**:An array overflows if its capacity is exceeded.

- **Queue**
- **Pointer**:Array requires managing two pointers. Usually implemented as circular array to reuse space. Linked list has no overflow unless memory exhausted


## Pros/Cons
- **Stack**
- **Pros**:**Push and pop operations are performed efficiently.
- **Cons**:Array may waste unused slots if not full.

- **Queue**
- **Pros**:**Push and pop operations are performed efficiently.
- **Cons**:Circular array may overflow.
